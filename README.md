# CrossFrameTest
Testing Cross Frame KeyLogging for vuln sites

Modern browser in correct config should block this pretty quickly, end user won't be alerted to whats happening

Realistically this will only work with older versions of internet explorer (IE) who will probably not action x-frame-options header

Easily Prevented by same preventation as Clickjacking i.e X-Frame-Options header

Replace Iframe url with page you wish to spoof in order to use this
